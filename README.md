# ios-bluebox-app
A utility app of a company for viewing their pdf documents.

This is a freelance project I made for a company. It allows them to securely view their company pdf documents by scanning a specific QR code for each file. In that way other people outside will not be able to view their files even they downloaded the app. This app works on both the iPhone and iPad and is fully written in Swift.
