# ios-bluebox-app
A utility app of a company for viewing their pdf documents.

This is a freelance project I made for a company. It allows them to securely view their company pdf documents by scanning a specific QR code for each file. In that way outsiders won't be able to view their files even if they downloaded the app. This app works on both the iPhone and iPad and is fully written in Swift.
